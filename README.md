# system-update
A small bundle of scripts with functions that makes updating your apt-based Linux system easier, safer and sexier. 
Bash Function Library brings you the feeling of running a formal Debian- or Debian-derivative systems function. 

Included in this package is a collection of scripts with focus on simplicity and safety. 
Everyone using Linux does not share the equal amount of deep appreciation for learning a lot of regex or coding
scripts the way some of us do. I want to help you get things done without studying new or complex concepts
related to Linux systems structure, administrative functions and so forth; The list below will explain some of what you'll 
be able to do from a simple command and enjoyable user interfaces, even when operating in the console/terminal.

- System-wide updating and upgrading in a safe and secure way with a single command and a graphical progress-bar.
- A search function to find specific commands wthin your reach (E.g $PATH) that allows the use of wildcards
- Preference based commands that will allow you to disable or enable the use of the internal speaker (beep) 
- A simple and effective whatis command to retrieve your external IP, both v4 and v6

This and much more which I will continue to add to this description as I add them to the collection.
Enjoy!
